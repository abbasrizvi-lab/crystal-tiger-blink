## Innovation Character
### Product Requirements Document (Final)

### Summary

Innovation requires more than technical skill—it demands character. Yet most professionals lack systematic approaches to develop the virtues that fuel breakthrough thinking: courage to challenge assumptions, humility to learn from failure, wisdom to navigate complexity, and empathy to understand user needs. Current productivity tools optimize for efficiency but ignore the character development that drives meaningful innovation.

We're building an agentic AI system that bridges this gap by helping users identify, develop, and apply character traits to drive innovation. The system will assess users' character profiles, provide personalized virtue-based coaching with philosophical wisdom, and analyze their daily work patterns, leveraging detailed insights from time, date, historical data, behavioral patterns, and expressed user interests, to identify opportunities for character-driven growth and innovation.

This isn't just another productivity app—it's a character formation platform that recognizes virtue as the foundation of both personal excellence and breakthrough innovation, operationalizing proven character development strategies through intelligent automation designed to provide the best possible user experience.
